#+Title:Chef Box: Chef Vagrant Boxes & Playground
#+AUTHOR:Tim Dysinger

This project enables you to automatically build a complete set of
[[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] boxes for use with [[http://vagrantup.com][Vagrant]].  The boxes are built with the
[[http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Package%2BInstallation%2Bon%2BDebian%2Band%2BUbuntu][Official OpsCode Chef 0.10 Ubuntu Packages]] baked in.  This means you
can start either a Chef Server or Client Node easily at boot time.

Also included in this project is the Vagrant scaffolding to launch a
Chef cluster on your Desktop.  The default 'vagrant up' starts a Chef
Server & 2 Chef Client Nodes.  The nodes are setup to automatically
join the Chef cluster.  You can practice your cookbook, search, knife
and shef skills really easily with 3 disposable nodes.  See the
examples below for more info.

You can also merge the contents of this project into your existing
[[https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo][Chef Repo]] and record, as an artifact in your git repository, how you
built your Vagrant Box instead of it being mystery-meat from the
interweb cache.

* Requirements

  - [[http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]] 4.0.10
  - [[http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/][RVM]] latest

* Setup

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
  #+END_SRC

* Build

  Example: Build a Natty 64bit Box

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
rake box:natty64
  #+END_SRC

  Warning: Building a Vagrant Box takes about 20 minutes on my i7
  MacBook Pro - go get some lunch & come back

  Example: Build a LTS Lucid 32bit Box

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
rake box:lucid32
  #+END_SRC

  Example: Build All Boxes

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
rake box:all
  #+END_SRC

  Warning: Takes several hours to build 32 & 64 bit boxes for Lucid,
  Maverick & Natty - do it at night when you wont be tapping your
  foot.

* Launch

  Example: Launch a 3-Node Natty64 Cluster

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
vagrant up
  #+END_SRC

  Example: Launch a 3-Node Lucid32 Cluster

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
BOX=lucid32 vagrant up
  #+END_SRC

  Example: Only 1 Chef Server & 1 Chef Client Node

  #+BEGIN_SRC: sh
vagrant up chef.vm
vagrant up node0.vm
  #+END_SRC

knife node run_list add chef.vm "chef::server"
knife node run_list add node0.vm "apt"
knife node run_list add node1.vm "apt"
knife node run_list add node0.vm "chef"
knife node run_list add node1.vm "chef"
    #+END_SRC

*** SSH

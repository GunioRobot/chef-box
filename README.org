#+Title:Chef Box: Chef Vagrant Boxes & Playground
#+AUTHOR:Tim Dysinger
#+EMAIL:tim@dysinger.net

This project enables you to automatically build a complete set of
[[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] boxes for use with [[http://vagrantup.com][Vagrant]].  The boxes are built with the
[[http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Package%2BInstallation%2Bon%2BDebian%2Band%2BUbuntu][Official OpsCode Chef 0.10.4 Ubuntu Packages]] baked in.  This means you
can start either a Chef Server or Client Node easily at boot time.

Also included in this project is the Vagrant scaffolding to launch a
Chef cluster on your Desktop.  The default 'vagrant up' starts a Chef
Server & 2 Chef Client Nodes.  The nodes are setup to automatically
join the Chef cluster.  You can practice your cookbook, search, knife
and shef skills really easily with 3 disposable nodes.  See the
examples below for more info.

You can also merge the contents of this project into your existing
[[https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo][Chef Repo]] and record, as an artifact in your git repository, how you
built your Vagrant Box instead of it being mystery-meat from the
interweb cache.
